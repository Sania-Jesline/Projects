About the Project :

This project is an AI-powered private resource sharing platform designed to simplify how users upload, search, and retrieve relevant 
study materials within a closed community. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable context-aware search rather than relying on 
basic keyword matching. Users can upload documents, enter natural-language queries, and receive the most relevant resources based on semantic similarity. 
A simple web interface makes it easy to interact with the system, while cloud integration ensures data is stored securely and can be accessed in real-time.

Tech Stack :

Python – Core programming language used for backend development, NLP processing, and integration.
Scikit-learn & NLTK – Used for TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and basic question-answering features.
Gradio – Provides a lightweight and interactive web interface for file uploads and search queries.
Firebase – Handles real-time storage and retrieval of uploaded files and associated metadata.

Use Cases :

Academic groups or university departments sharing notes, assignments, and research papers.
Organizations building internal knowledge bases for easy resource discovery.
Research teams collaborating on shared documentation with intelligent search.
Online learning communities offering AI-enhanced access to content libraries.
